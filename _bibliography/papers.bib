  abstract = "Forms constitute a large portion of layout-rich documents that
              convey information through key-value pairs. Form understanding
              involves two main tasks, namely, the identification of keys and
              values (a.k.a Key Information Extraction or KIE) and the
              association of keys to corresponding values (a.k.a. Relation
              Extraction or RE). State of the art models for form understanding
              often rely on training paradigms that yield poorly calibrated
              output probabilities and low performance on RE. In this paper, we
              present AliGATr, a graph-based model that uses a generative
              objective to represent complex grid-like layouts that are often
              found in forms. Using a grid-based graph topology, our model learns
              to generate the layout of each page token by token in a data
              efficient manner. Despite using 30{\%} fewer parameters than the
              smallest SotA, AliGATr performs on par with or better than SotA
              models on the KIE and RE tasks against four datasets. We also show
              that AliGATr{'}s output probabilities are better calibrated and do
              not exhibit the over-confident distributions of other SotA models.",

    abstract = "Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) models have evolved at an impressive rate over the past few years, coming close to or matching human performance on some benchmarks. We argue that common evaluation metrics used by popular benchmarks do not account for the semantic and multimodal groundedness of a model{'}s outputs. As a result, hallucinations and major semantic errors are treated the same way as well-grounded outputs, and the evaluation scores do not reflect the reasoning capabilities of the model. In response, we propose a new evaluation methodology that accounts for the groundedness of predictions with regard to the semantic characteristics of the output as well as the multimodal placement of the output within the input document. Our proposed methodology is parameterized in such a way that users can configure the score according to their preferences. We validate our scoring methodology using human judgment and show its potential impact on existing popular leaderboards. Through extensive analyses, we demonstrate that our proposed method produces scores that are a better indicator of a model{'}s robustness and tends to give higher rewards to better-calibrated answers."
