Hi! I’m Siddharth, a student at Carnegie Mellon University where I'm completing my
Fifth-Year Master's in Computer Science. I am currently focused on 
interpretability - specifically, uncovering the internal circuits and 
representation geometry that LLMs use to parse and reason over structured data.

As a part of Professor [Carolyn Rosé's][rose] group at CMU's Language Technologies Institute - I collaborated
with [Armineh Nourbakhsh][nourbakhsh] on developing graph-based models for form
processing, and robust evaluation metrics for document visual question answering.

I am also fascinated by the intersection of game theory and AI — particularly, how 
optimal play emerges in complex environments. I find that viewing 
deep learning through this lens — as players discovering complex strategies in a massive game -
makes for a compelling perspective driving interpretability research.


Feel free to reach out to me to chat about my research or any shared interests!
