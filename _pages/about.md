Hi! I’m Siddharth, a Computer Science student at CMU, completing my undergraduate studies and transitioning into the fifth-year Master's program. My current research interests lie in the intersection of natural language processing, machine learning, and game theory - towards building intelligent systems using language agents. 

I've worked extensively with Professor [Carolyn Rosé's][rose] Document Understanding Group at CMU's Language Technologies Institute - collaborating with [Armineh Nourbakhsh][nourbakhsh] on developing graph-based models for form processing, and robust evaluation metrics for document visual question answering. 

Zooming out, I often find myself along the confluence of mathematics and computer science hoping to find innovative applications with strong theoretical foundations.

Feel free to reach out to me to chat about my research or any shared interests!
