Hi! I’m Siddharth, a student at Carnegie Mellon University where I'm completing my
Fifth-Year Master's in Computer Science. My current research interests lie in
factuality and how knowledge is learned and represented within Large Language Models.

I've worked extensively with Professor [Carolyn Rosé's][rose] Document
Understanding Group at CMU's Language Technologies Institute - collaborating
with [Armineh Nourbakhsh][nourbakhsh] on developing graph-based models for form
processing, and robust evaluation metrics for document visual question answering.

Zooming out, I often find myself digging into the weeds of deep neural networks
hoping to uncover something interesting.

Feel free to reach out to me to chat about my research or any shared interests!
