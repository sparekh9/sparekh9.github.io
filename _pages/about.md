Hi! I'm Siddharth, a senior studying Computer Science at CMU. My current research interests lie in the intersection of natural language processing, machine learning, and game theory - towards building intelligent systems using language agents. 

I've worked extensively with Professor [Carolyn Ros√©'s][rose] Document Understanding Group at CMU's Language Technologies Institute - collaborating with [Armineh Nourbakhsh][nourbakhsh] on developing graph-based models for form processing, and robust evaluation metrics for document visual question answering. 

Zooming out, I often find myself in a random walk by the convergence of mathematics and computer science in machine learning. To this end, I hope to develop innovative solutions across disciplines with strong theoretical foundations. 

Feel free to reach out to me to chat about my research or any shared interests!
