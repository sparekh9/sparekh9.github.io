In this paper, we present AliGATr, a graph-based model that uses a generative objective to represent complex grid-like layouts that are often found in forms. Using a grid-based graph topology, our model learns to generate the layout of each page token by token in a data efficient manner."}],"skills":[{"name":"Programming Languages","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["C/C++","Python","Java","JavaScript","Julia","OCaml"]},{"name":"Machine Learning","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["PyTorch","Tensorflow","Transformers","Scikit-Learn","NumPy","Pandas"]},{"name":"Cloud","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["AWS","Google Cloud Platform"]},{"name":"Miscellaneous","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Git","Docker"]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Native","icon":""},{"language":"Gujarati","fluency":"Native","icon":""},{"language":"Hindi","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Spanish","fluency":"Beginner","icon":""}],"interests":[],"projects":[]}
